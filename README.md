# OIP Image Processing Assignment 2

Repository for working on assignment 2 in the OIP course at SDU.

## Setting Up Development Environment

### Requirements

- Python 3

This project uses Jupyter notebooks and pipenv.

If you have not installed pipenv, use `pip install pipenv`

Once pipenv is installed, run `pipenv sync --dev` inside the repository. This will install the packages specified in the pipfile.

To activate this project's virtualenv, run `pipenv shell`

Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with `pipenv run`

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

To run a Jupyter notebook, run the command `jupyter notebook` either inside the pipenv shell or using `pipenv run jupyter notebook`

Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter plugin to edit Jupyter notebook without running Jupyter in the browser.
